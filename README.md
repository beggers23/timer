TIMER
=====

Multi-split stop watch application. Splits are subtracted from the original running time. Cumulative time is kept.

Application was created so that I could have an additional stop watch at swim meets to keep track of my swimmers times and their individual splits in each event.

Application is responsive and is written using Vue.js and Flex Box. Front-End only application.
